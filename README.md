# Aluminum PCB Reflow Heater

## Overview

The Aluminum PCB Reflow Heater is a compact and efficient device designed for solder reflow applications, making it an ideal solution for hobbyists, makers, and small-scale electronics enthusiasts. This versatile heater requires only an adjustable DC power supply, providing a cost-effective and user-friendly alternative to traditional reflow ovens.

## Features

- **Cheap Design** Only m3 screws and nuts, an adjustable dc power supply and wires are required to build this project.
- **Cheap PCB** You can get 100 * 100 mm aluminum pcbs very cheaply (mine were provided by [pcbway](https://www.pcbway.com) free of charge)
- **Open source** Hardware licensed under MIT License and creating using KiCad


## Specifications

- **Input Voltage:** DC or AC 24V-30V (Dependent on power and temperature)
- **Power Consumption:** 60 - 100 W (Dependent on temperature)
- **Heating element resistance:** ≈3.4Ω
- **Temperature Range:** Adjustable based on user preferences (typically 150°C to 250°C)
- **Heating Element:** Aluminum PCB with embedded heating elements

## Setup Instructions

1. **Power Supply Connection:** Connect the Aluminum PCB Reflow Heater to a compatible adjustable DC power supply using the smd solder pads for wires.

2. **Voltage Setting:** Set the desired voltage on the dc power supply and measure the temperature using a thermocouple or an infrared thermometer. Ensure that the temperature range is appropriate for the solder paste being used.

3. **Preheat:** Allow the device to preheat until it reaches the required temperature.

4. **Reflow Process:** Once preheated, carefully place the PCB with solder paste onto the heater surface..

5. **Cool Down:** After completing the reflow process, allow the PCB to cool down naturally before handling.
